# maersk_coding_challenge

To run, just clone the project and double click on the index.html file. It will run in your browser.
As instructed, I have not used any frameworks or external librariers. I created the task using only Javascript, HTML and CSS. That's why no need of any compiler or command based run. 
Please find some mscreenshots of the running application in the asset folder within the project. 
To test mobile view, i tested it using the console mobile view. Can be tested using the same.
